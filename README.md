Popular Movies App
==================

#Project Summary
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, youâ€™ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

In order for the Popular Movie App to function properly, an API key for themoviedb.org must be included with the build.

You should obtain a key via the following [instructions](http://www.themoviedb.org), and include the unique key for the build by adding the following line to [USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties

`MyTheMovieDbApiKey="<UNIQUE_API_KEY">`
